Sorry... I'm not gonna translate the description, but it's like a wharehouse management app
where you choose the items and they g oto the basket. The app keeps track of the amount,
total price and stuff, and then you can print out the receipt.

Things used:

+ React.js
+ react-icons
+ ES6

You can play with the app here: https://lconstantine.github.io/warehouse-app/

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
